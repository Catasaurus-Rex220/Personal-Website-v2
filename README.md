# Personal-Website-v2
Notes on the website:

The html elements are stored in div with classes named after the pages. 
This leads to a cleaner css sheet.

The navbar and footer are outside the class divs beacuse they are the same for every page.

The page is optimised only for desktop and is very limited on smaller screens.
